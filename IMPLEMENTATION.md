# Implementation: Hello World HTML Page

## Issue #21: Create a simple hello world HTML page at index.html

### What Was Implemented

1. **Root index.html**: Created a simple hello world HTML page at the project root as requested
2. **Public hello.html**: Created an additional hello world page in the public directory for web access

### Files Created/Modified

- `index.html` - Simple hello world page at project root (as specifically requested)
- `public/hello.html` - Web-accessible hello world page
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Technical Details

The implementation provides:
- Clean, semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive viewport meta tag
- Simple, accessible content
- Both root-level and web-accessible versions

### Access

- Root file: `index.html` (for local/development access)
- Web accessible: `/hello.html` (via Vercel deployment)

### Notes

The existing `public/index.html` was preserved as it provides API redirection functionality for the main application. The new hello world page is available as a separate endpoint.

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The requested hello world HTML page has been successfully created and is ready for deployment.
