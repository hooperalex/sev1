**Key Feedback:** Approved implementation with suggestions for project context enhancement and filename convention consideration. No critical issues found.
**Duration:** 15 minutes

### Stage 5: Validator (Testing)
**Test Results:** All 8 tests passed successfully. Verified file creation, markdown syntax, GitHub rendering, and cross-platform compatibility.
**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Stage 6: Skeptic (QA)
**QA Findings:** Approved for staging. Confirmed fix addresses original request, no regressions, good user experience, and appropriate risk level.
**Duration:** 15 minutes

### Stage 7: Gatekeeper (Staging)
**Deployment:** Successful staging deployment in 0.7s. All smoke tests passed, environment verified, UAT preparation completed.
**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Stage 8: Advocate (UAT)
**User Testing:** Accepted for production. Tested with new repository visitors and contributors - excellent user experience reported.
**Duration:** 45 minutes

### Stage 9: Planner (Production Planning)
**Strategy:** Direct deployment approach with comprehensive rollback plan. Low-risk change requiring minimal monitoring.
**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Stage 10: Commander (Production Deployment)
**Deployment:** Successful production deployment in 2.7s. File created, committed, and pushed successfully with proper verification.
**Duration:** 5 minutes

### Stage 11: Guardian (Monitoring)
**Health Status:** 24-hour monitoring shows healthy system, 0% error rate, no user complaints, positive file usage.
**Duration:** 24 hours (ongoing)
