      "output": "# Bug Triage Report\n\n## Summary\nRequest for web frontend development using Vercel deployment platform\n\n## Severity Classification\n**Priority:** P2 (Medium)\n\n**Justification:**\nThis is not a bug but rather a feature request/development task. It's foundational infrastructure work that's important for the project but doesn't represent a system failure or user-impacting issue. Classified as P2 since it appears to be core functionality needed for the application.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Users Affected:** 0 (no existing users can be affected by missing feature)\n- **Business Impact:** Medium (foundational requirement for user access)\n- **Security Risk:** No - this is a development request, not a security vulnerability\n- **Data Loss Risk:** No - no existing data or functionality at risk\n- **Workaround Available:** N/A - this is a new feature request\n\n## Affected Components\nThis appears to be a greenfield development task affecting:\n- Frontend application structure\n- Vercel deployment configuration\n- Routing and navigation systems\n- UI/UX components\n- Build and deployment pipeline\n\n## Reproducibility\n**Status:** N/A - Not Applicable\n\n**Reproduction Steps:** This is not a bug to reproduce, but rather a development requirement. No steps needed.\n\n## Preliminary Root Cause Analysis\nThis is not a bug requiring root cause analysis. This appears to be:\n- A new project requirement\n- Initial development planning\n- Infrastructure setup task\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n1. **Clarify Requirements:** The Archaeologist should gather more specific requirements about:\n   - What type of website/application is needed\n   - Target audience and use cases\n   - Required features and functionality\n   - Design requirements or preferences\n   - Technology stack preferences (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)\n\n2. **Technical Planning:**\n   - Determine appropriate frontend framework\n   - Plan Vercel deployment configuration\n   - Establish development workflow\n\n3. **Project Setup:**\n   - Initialize frontend project structure\n   - Configure Vercel deployment\n   - Set up development environment\n\n## Additional Notes\n- This issue lacks specific requirements and acceptance criteria\n- Consider converting this to an Epic or Project rather than a single issue\n- May need to break down into smaller, more specific development tasks\n- The issue title and description suggest this might be the initial setup phase of a new project\n- Recommend gathering stakeholder input on specific website requirements before proceeding with development\n\n**Recommendation:** This should be reclassified as a \"Feature Request\" or \"Epic\" rather than a bug, and broken down into more specific, actionable development tasks.",

      "output": "# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis is not a bug requiring root cause analysis, but rather a feature request for initial project setup. The \"root cause\" is that no web frontend currently exists for this project, and the team needs to establish the foundational web application infrastructure using Vercel as the deployment platform.\n\n## Bug Location\n**File:** N/A - No existing codebase to analyze\n**Function/Method:** N/A - This is a greenfield development request\n**Line(s):** N/A - No code exists yet\n\n## Code Analysis\n\n### Current Implementation\n```\n[No code exists - this appears to be a new project initialization]\n```\n\n**What it does:**\nCurrently, there is no web frontend implementation in the repository.\n\n**Why it's \"buggy\":**\nThis isn't a bug in the traditional sense - it's the absence of required functionality. The project needs a web frontend to serve users, but none has been implemented yet.\n\n### Git History\n**Repository Analysis:**\nBased on the issue being #2 in the repository, this appears to be a very early-stage project. The repository likely contains minimal or no frontend code.\n\n**Original Intent:**\nThis appears to be initial project planning and requirement gathering for establishing a web presence.\n\n**What Went Wrong:**\nNothing went wrong - this is normal project initialization. The team is identifying the need for a web frontend as part of their development roadmap.\n\n## Root Cause Explanation\n\nThe \"root cause\" of this issue is project scope definition rather than a technical bug:\n\n1. **Missing Infrastructure**: No web frontend application has been created yet\n2. **Deployment Platform Selected**: Team has chosen Vercel as their deployment platform\n3. **Development Phase**: Project is in early planning/setup phase\n4. **Resource Allocation**: Team needs to allocate development resources to build the frontend\n\nThis represents a normal development lifecycle stage where foundational components are being identified and planned.\n\n## Impact Scope\n\n**Affected Code Paths:**\n- No existing code paths affected\n- All future user-facing functionality will depend on this frontend\n\n**Dependent Components:**\n- Backend APIs (if they exist) will need frontend integration\n- Authentication systems will need UI components\n- Data visualization will need frontend frameworks\n- User management will need interface components\n\n**Potential Side Effects:**\n- No negative side effects from implementing this\n- Only positive impact of enabling user access to the application\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\n**Approach:** New Feature Development (Greenfield Project Setup)\n\n**What Needs to Change:**\n1. **Requirements Gathering:**\n   - Define specific website functionality requirements\n   - Identify target user personas and use cases\n   - Establish design system and branding guidelines\n   - Determine required pages and user flows\n\n2. **Technology Stack Selection:**\n   - Choose frontend framework (React, Next.js, Vue.js, etc.)\n   - Select UI component library\n   - Determine state management approach\n   - Plan API integration strategy\n\n3. **Project Initialization:**\n   - Set up frontend project structure\n   - Configure build and development tools\n   - Establish code quality tools (linting, testing)\n   - Create initial component architecture\n\n4. **Vercel Integration:**\n   - Configure Vercel deployment settings\n   - Set up continuous deployment pipeline\n   - Configure environment variables and secrets\n   - Establish domain and routing configuration\n\n**Why This Approach:**\nThis systematic approach ensures proper foundation setup and scalable architecture from the beginning, preventing technical debt and rework later.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Minimal risks for new development\n- Potential for scope creep without clear requirements\n- Technology choice lock-in effects\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Using other deployment platforms (Netlify, AWS, etc.) - Vercel already selected\n- Different frontend approaches (SSG, SPA, SSR) - depends on requirements\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n**Test Cases Needed:**\n1. **Deployment Pipeline Testing:**\n   - Verify Vercel deployment works correctly\n   - Test build process and optimization\n   - Validate environment configuration\n\n2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**\n   - Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n   - Verify mobile responsiveness\n   - Check accessibility compliance\n\n**Edge Cases to Cover:**\n- Network connectivity issues\n- Different device sizes and orientations\n- Various browser versions\n- Performance on slower connections\n\n**Regression Risks:**\n- No existing functionality to regress\n- Future changes should be tested against initial implementation\n\n## Additional Context\n\n**Related Issues:**\n- This is issue #2, suggesting very early project stage\n- Likely will spawn multiple sub-issues for specific features\n\n**Documentation Impact:**\n- Will need to create development setup documentation\n- Deployment process documentation required\n- User documentation for the website features\n\n**Performance Impact:**\n- No existing performance to impact\n- Should establish performance benchmarks from the start\n\n## Confidence Level\n**Certainty:** High\n\nThis is clearly a feature request for initial project setup rather than a bug requiring traditional root cause analysis.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- This is a new project requiring frontend development\n- Vercel is the confirmed deployment platform choice\n- Team has development resources available for this work\n\n**Further Investigation Needed:**\n1. **Stakeholder Requirements:**\n   - What specific functionality does the website need?\n   - Who are the target users?\n   - What are the business objectives?\n\n2. **Technical Constraints:**\n   - Are there existing backend systems to integrate with?\n   - What are the performance requirements?\n   - Are there specific compliance or security requirements?\n\n3. **Timeline and Resources:**\n   - What is the expected delivery timeline?\n   - Who will be developing the frontend?\n   - What is the budget for this development?\n\n**Recommendation for Next Steps:**\nConvert this issue into an Epic with specific, actionable sub-tasks such as:\n- Requirements gathering and documentation\n- Technology stack selection and approval\n- Project initialization and setup\n- Basic page structure implementation\n- Vercel deployment configuration\n- Testing and quality assurance setup",
