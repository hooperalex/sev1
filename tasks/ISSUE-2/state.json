      "output": "# Bug Triage Report\n\n## Summary\nRequest for web frontend development using Vercel platform\n\n## Severity Classification\n**Priority:** P2 (Medium)\n\n**Justification:**\nThis is not a bug but rather a feature request/development task. It's foundational infrastructure that needs to be built, but it's not blocking existing functionality since no website currently exists. Priority is medium as it's likely a core deliverable for the project.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Users Affected:** 0 (no existing users - this is net new functionality)\n- **Business Impact:** High (foundational requirement for user access)\n- **Security Risk:** No (this is a development request, not a vulnerability)\n- **Data Loss Risk:** No (no existing data to lose)\n- **Workaround Available:** No (no alternative way to access the application)\n\n## Affected Components\nThis appears to be a greenfield development request affecting:\n- Frontend application (to be created)\n- Vercel deployment configuration\n- Potentially routing and navigation structure\n- UI/UX components and layouts\n\n## Reproducibility\n**Status:** Not Applicable\n\n**Reproduction Steps:** N/A - This is a feature request, not a reproducible bug\n\n## Preliminary Root Cause Analysis\nThis is not a bug requiring root cause analysis. This appears to be:\n- A development task for creating initial web frontend\n- Possibly part of project setup/initialization phase\n- May indicate the project is in early stages and needs basic infrastructure\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n1. **Clarify Requirements:** The Archaeologist should gather more specific requirements:\n   - What type of website/application is needed?\n   - What are the core features and pages required?\n   - Are there design specifications or wireframes?\n   - What framework/technology stack is preferred?\n\n2. **Technical Investigation:**\n   - Review existing codebase structure (if any)\n   - Check current Vercel configuration\n   - Identify any existing backend APIs that need frontend integration\n\n3. **Project Planning:**\n   - Break this down into smaller, actionable development tasks\n   - Define acceptance criteria for the website\n   - Establish timeline and milestones\n\n## Additional Notes\n- This issue is misclassified as a bug when it should be labeled as a \"feature request\" or \"enhancement\"\n- The issue description lacks sufficient detail for development work to begin\n- Consider creating a project template or using a starter kit for faster development\n- May want to close this issue and create more specific, actionable issues for individual website components/pages\n- Recommend establishing issue templates to better categorize future requests\n\n**Recommendation:** Reclassify this issue as a feature request and request more detailed requirements before proceeding with development work.",

      "output": "# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis is not a bug requiring root cause analysis, but rather a feature request for initial web frontend development. The \"root cause\" is that no website currently exists and one needs to be built using Vercel as the deployment platform.\n\n## Bug Location\n**File:** N/A - No existing codebase to analyze\n**Function/Method:** N/A\n**Line(s):** N/A\n\n## Code Analysis\n\n### Current Implementation\n```\nNo existing frontend implementation found\n```\n\n**What it does:**\nCurrently, there is no web frontend implementation in the repository.\n\n**Why it's \"buggy\":**\nThis isn't a bug - it's a missing feature. The project appears to be in its initial stages and lacks a web interface for users to interact with the application.\n\n### Git History\nBased on repository analysis, this appears to be a new project without existing frontend infrastructure.\n\n**Introduced in:** N/A (feature never existed)\n**Date:** N/A\n**Author:** N/A\n**Commit message:** N/A\n\n**Original Intent:**\nThe project was likely started without a frontend component, possibly focusing on backend/API development first.\n\n**What Went Wrong:**\nNothing went wrong - this is simply a development milestone that needs to be reached.\n\n## Root Cause Explanation\n\nThe \"root cause\" of this issue is project architecture planning rather than a technical bug:\n\n1. **Missing Component**: The project lacks a web frontend entirely\n2. **Development Phase**: This appears to be early-stage project setup where core infrastructure components are being identified and built\n3. **Platform Choice**: Vercel has been selected as the deployment platform, indicating a preference for modern JAMstack architecture\n4. **Scope Gap**: There's a gap between backend services (if any exist) and user-facing interface\n\nThis is fundamentally a project planning and development task rather than a defect to be fixed.\n\n## Impact Scope\n\n**Affected Code Paths:**\n- No existing code paths affected\n- All future user interactions will depend on this frontend\n\n**Dependent Components:**\n- User authentication (if backend exists)\n- API integrations (if backend services exist)\n- Routing and navigation\n- UI/UX components\n- State management\n\n**Potential Side Effects:**\nNo side effects since no existing functionality exists to break.\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\n**Approach:** New Feature Development (Architectural Implementation)\n\n**What Needs to Change:**\n1. Create project structure for frontend application\n2. Set up Vercel deployment configuration\n3. Implement basic routing and navigation\n4. Create core UI components and layouts\n5. Integrate with any existing backend services\n6. Configure build and deployment pipeline\n\n**Why This Approach:**\nThis requires net-new development rather than fixing existing code. A systematic approach building from foundation up is most appropriate.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Minimal technical risks since no existing functionality to break\n- Timeline risk if requirements are not well-defined\n- Integration risk if backend APIs are not well-documented\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Using different deployment platforms (Netlify, AWS Amplify)\n- Different frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte)\n- Static site generators vs. dynamic applications\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n**Test Cases Needed:**\n1. Vercel deployment pipeline functionality\n2. Basic page loading and navigation\n3. Responsive design across devices\n4. Performance and loading speed\n5. SEO and accessibility compliance\n\n**Edge Cases to Cover:**\n- Mobile device compatibility\n- Different browser support\n- Network connectivity issues\n- Various screen sizes and resolutions\n\n**Regression Risks:**\nNone - this is new development with no existing functionality to regress.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n**Related Issues:**\n- May need additional issues for specific pages/components\n- Backend API integration issues may be related\n- Design system and UI/UX issues may be dependencies\n\n**Documentation Impact:**\n- Will need user documentation/help pages\n- Developer documentation for deployment and maintenance\n- API documentation if integrating with backend services\n\n**Performance Impact:**\n- New frontend will introduce performance considerations\n- Need to establish performance baselines and monitoring\n- Consider bundle size optimization and loading strategies\n\n## Confidence Level\n**Certainty:** High\n\nThis is clearly a development task rather than a bug fix. The analysis is straightforward since there's no existing code to debug.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Project is in early development phase\n- Vercel is the confirmed deployment platform\n- Standard web frontend technologies will be used\n- Some form of backend services may already exist\n\n**Further Investigation Needed:**\n1. **Requirements Gathering**: What specific functionality should the website provide?\n2. **Technical Stack**: What frontend framework/library should be used?\n3. **Design Specifications**: Are there mockups, wireframes, or design requirements?\n4. **Backend Integration**: What APIs or services need to be integrated?\n5. **Timeline and Resources**: What's the expected delivery timeline and who will develop it?\n\n**Recommendation for Project Team:**\nClose this issue and create more specific, actionable development tasks such as:\n- \"Set up React/Next.js project with Vercel deployment\"\n- \"Create landing page design and implementation\"\n- \"Implement user authentication frontend\"\n- \"Set up routing and navigation structure\"\n\nThis will provide better tracking and allow for more focused development work.",
