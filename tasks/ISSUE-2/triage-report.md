# Bug Triage Report

## Summary
Request for web frontend development using Vercel deployment platform

## Severity Classification
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

**Justification:**
This is not a bug but rather a feature request/development task. It's foundational infrastructure work that's important for the project but doesn't represent a system failure or user-impacting issue. Classified as P2 since it appears to be core functionality needed for the application.

## Impact Assessment
- **Users Affected:** 0 (no existing users can be affected by missing feature)
- **Business Impact:** Medium (foundational requirement for user access)
- **Security Risk:** No - this is a development request, not a security vulnerability
- **Data Loss Risk:** No - no existing data or functionality at risk
- **Workaround Available:** N/A - this is a new feature request

## Affected Components
This appears to be a greenfield development task affecting:
- Frontend application structure
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Routing and navigation systems
- UI/UX components
- Build and deployment pipeline

## Reproducibility
**Status:** N/A - Not Applicable

**Reproduction Steps:** This is not a bug to reproduce, but rather a development requirement. No steps needed.

## Preliminary Root Cause Analysis
This is not a bug requiring root cause analysis. This appears to be:
- A new project requirement
- Initial development planning
- Infrastructure setup task

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Clarify Requirements:** The Archaeologist should gather more specific requirements about:
   - What type of website/application is needed
   - Target audience and use cases
   - Required features and functionality
   - Design requirements or preferences
   - Technology stack preferences (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)

2. **Technical Planning:**
   - Determine appropriate frontend framework
   - Plan Vercel deployment configuration
   - Establish development workflow

3. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialize frontend project structure
   - Configure Vercel deployment
   - Set up development environment

## Additional Notes
- This issue lacks specific requirements and acceptance criteria
- Consider converting this to an Epic or Project rather than a single issue
- May need to break down into smaller, more specific development tasks
- The issue title and description suggest this might be the initial setup phase of a new project
- Recommend gathering stakeholder input on specific website requirements before proceeding with development

**Recommendation:** This should be reclassified as a "Feature Request" or "Epic" rather than a bug, and broken down into more specific, actionable development tasks.
