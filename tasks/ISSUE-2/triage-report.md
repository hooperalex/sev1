# Bug Triage Report

## Summary
Request for web frontend development using Vercel platform

## Severity Classification
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

**Justification:**
This is not a bug but rather a feature request/development task. It's foundational infrastructure that needs to be built, but it's not blocking existing functionality since no website currently exists. Priority is medium as it's likely a core deliverable for the project.

## Impact Assessment
- **Users Affected:** 0 (no existing users - this is net new functionality)
- **Business Impact:** High (foundational requirement for user access)
- **Security Risk:** No (this is a development request, not a vulnerability)
- **Data Loss Risk:** No (no existing data to lose)
- **Workaround Available:** No (no alternative way to access the application)

## Affected Components
This appears to be a greenfield development request affecting:
- Frontend application (to be created)
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Potentially routing and navigation structure
- UI/UX components and layouts

## Reproducibility
**Status:** Not Applicable

**Reproduction Steps:** N/A - This is a feature request, not a reproducible bug

## Preliminary Root Cause Analysis
This is not a bug requiring root cause analysis. This appears to be:
- A development task for creating initial web frontend
- Possibly part of project setup/initialization phase
- May indicate the project is in early stages and needs basic infrastructure

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Clarify Requirements:** The Archaeologist should gather more specific requirements:
   - What type of website/application is needed?
   - What are the core features and pages required?
   - Are there design specifications or wireframes?
   - What framework/technology stack is preferred?

2. **Technical Investigation:**
   - Review existing codebase structure (if any)
   - Check current Vercel configuration
   - Identify any existing backend APIs that need frontend integration

3. **Project Planning:**
   - Break this down into smaller, actionable development tasks
   - Define acceptance criteria for the website
   - Establish timeline and milestones

## Additional Notes
- This issue is misclassified as a bug when it should be labeled as a "feature request" or "enhancement"
- The issue description lacks sufficient detail for development work to begin
- Consider creating a project template or using a starter kit for faster development
- May want to close this issue and create more specific, actionable issues for individual website components/pages
- Recommend establishing issue templates to better categorize future requests

**Recommendation:** Reclassify this issue as a feature request and request more detailed requirements before proceeding with development work.
