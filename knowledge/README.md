This folder is your Obsidian-compatible knowledge base for the AI Team MVP project.

## Structure

## How Agents Use This

1. **Before fixing bugs**: Agents search here for similar issues and solutions
2. **After fixing bugs**: Agents create post-mortems documenting what was learned
3. **For context**: Agents reference architecture docs to understand system design

## Obsidian Setup

1. Open Obsidian
2. Open folder as vault: `C:\Users\hoope\ai-team-mvp\knowledge`
3. Enable backlinks and graph view for better navigation
